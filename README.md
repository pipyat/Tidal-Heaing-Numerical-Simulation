# Tidal-Heaing-Numerical-Simulation

# This project used the symplectic Euler method to numerically simulate the orbit and tidal heating of Io as well as analyse the gravitational influences of Europa and Ganymede.

# In order to simulate the circularisation of orbits due to tidal heating, assume angular momentum is conserved as kinetic energy is instantaneously removed.  In practice, this means that radial velocity must be reduced at each time step while preserving tangential velocity.

# The final tidal heating  model  involves  numerically  calculating  the  trajectories  of  Io,  Europa,  and  Ganymede using the symplectic Euler method while taking mutual gravitational interactions into consideration.  After positions and velocities are updated, kinetic energy is instantaneously while conserving angular momentum. Orbit eccentricity is also continuously  updated.
